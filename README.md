# FeestwinkelApp
This is my Project for the course evaluation of Native Apps II. This project will be used as a real application for the store [Feestwinkel.be](https://www.feestwinkel.be). The application allows you to search the offer of firework and to see a demovideo. Next to this, you can sort the firework on alphabet, price, en type. It also let you scan the firework in the physical store to see the video. But you only can scan if you are actually there.

### Appstore
The application will be available in the appstore as soon as possible. I'm waiting for a review at this moment.
